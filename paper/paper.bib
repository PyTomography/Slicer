abstract = {There is a need for mathematical modelling for the evaluation of important parameters for photon imaging systems. A Monte Carlo program which simulates medical imaging nuclear detectors has been developed. Different materials can be chosen for the detector, a cover and a phantom. Cylindrical, spherical, rectangular and more complex phantom and source shapes can be simulated. Photoelectric, incoherent, coherent interactions and pair production are simulated. Different detector parameters, e.g. the energy pulse-height distribution and pulse pile-up due to finite decay time of the scintillation light emission, can be calculated. An energy resolution of the system is simulated by convolving the energy imparted with an energy-dependent Gaussian function. An image matrix of the centroid of the events in the detector can be simulated. Simulation of different collimators permits studies on spatial resolution and sensitivyt. Comparisons of our results with experimental data and other published results have shown good agreement. The usefulness of the Monte Carlo code for the accurately simulation of important parameters in scintillation camera systems, stationary as well as SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) systems, has been demonstrated.}

abstract={Bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging suffers from poor spatial resolution, but the image quality can be improved during SPECT reconstruction by using anatomical information derived from CT imaging. The purpose of this work was to compare two different anatomically guided SPECT reconstruction methods to ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) which is the most commonly used reconstruction method in nuclear medicine. The comparison was done in terms of lesion quantitation and lesion detectability. Anatomically guided Bayesian reconstruction (AMAP) and kernelized ordered subset expectation maximization (KEM) algorithms were implemented and compared against OSEM. Artificial lesions with a wide range of lesion-to-background contrasts were added to normal bone SPECT/CT studies. The quantitative accuracy was assessed by the error in lesion standardized uptake values and lesion detectability by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve generated by a non-prewhitening matched filter. AMAP and KEM provided significantly better quantitative accuracy than OSEM at all contrast levels. Accuracy was the highest when SPECT lesions were matched to a lesion on CT. Correspondingly, AMAP and KEM also had significantly better lesion detectability than OSEM at all contrast levels and reconstructions with matching CT lesions performed the best. Quantitative differences between AMAP and KEM algorithms were minor. Visually AMAP and KEM images looked similar. Anatomically guided reconstruction improves lesion quantitation and detectability markedly compared to OSEM. Differences between AMAP and KEM algorithms were small and thus probably clinically insignificant.},

title = {CASToR: a generic data organization and processing code framework for multi-modal and multi-dimensional tomographic reconstruction},
journal = {Physics in Medicine & Biology},
abstract = {In tomographic medical imaging (PET, SPECT, CT), differences in data acquisition and organization are a major hurdle for the development of tomographic reconstruction software. The implementation of a given reconstruction algorithm is usually limited to a specific set of conditions, depending on the modality, the purpose of the study, the input data, or on the characteristics of the reconstruction algorithm itself. It causes restricted or limited use of algorithms, differences in implementation, code duplication, impractical code development, and difficulties for comparing different methods. This work attempts to address these issues by proposing a unified and generic code framework for formatting, processing and reconstructing acquired multi-modal and multi-dimensional data.

The proposed iterative framework processes in the same way elements from list-mode (i.e. events) and histogrammed (i.e. sinogram or other bins) data sets. Each element is processed separately, which opens the way for highly parallel execution. A unique iterative algorithm engine makes use of generic core components corresponding to the main parts of the reconstruction process. Features that are specific to different modalities and algorithms are embedded into specific components inheriting from the generic abstract components. Temporal dimensions are taken into account in the core architecture.

The framework is implemented in an open-source C++ parallel platform, called CASToR (customizable and advanced software for tomographic reconstruction). Performance assessments show that the time loss due to genericity remains acceptable, being one order of magnitude slower compared to a manufacturer’s software optimized for computational efficiency for a given system geometry. Specific optimizations were made possible by the underlying data set organization and processing and allowed for an average speed-up factor ranging from 1.54 to 3.07 when compared to more conventional implementations. Using parallel programming, an almost linear speed-up increase (factor of 0.85 times number of cores) was obtained in a realistic clinical PET setting. In conclusion, the proposed framework offers a substantial flexibility for the integration of new reconstruction algorithms while maintaining computation efficiency.}
