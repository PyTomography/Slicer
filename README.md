# SPECT Tomographic Reconstruction 3D Slicer Extension

This is the official repository for the `Slicer` extension `SlicerSPECTRecon`.

This module enables the reconstruction of raw SPECT projection data, providing customizable options for image modeling and image reconstruction. The module has a SIMIND to DICOM converter to permit reconstruction of SIMIND Monte Carlo data.

The module is divided into the following sections:

- Data Converters: Provides tools for converting data from various sources into the DICOM format.
- Input Data: Users can select data from multiple bed positions after loading the projection data into the 3D Slicer DICOM database. 
- System Modeling: Allows users to define transforms that are used to build the system matrix.
- Likelihood: Allows users to choose their preferred likelihood function.
- Reconstruction Algorithm: Provides the option of selecting a preferred reconstruction algorithm and their associated parameters

Please refer to the `User_Manual.md` file for further information

## User interface

- Inputs
  - Input volume: input SPECT/CT dicom files, simind file (convert to dicom using the data converter)
- Outputs
  - Reconstructed volume: The volume will be saved under the specified name (or as the dataset name appended with _reconstructed) and will be located within the Subject Hierarchy in the Data Module.
